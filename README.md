# Rdot (JavaScript Signals for Godot! ü•≥)

## What is Rdot?

Rdot is inspired by most modern Web Frameworks that use a reactive programming model. It enables you to write GDScript with syntax similar to [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) / [Solid](https://www.solidjs.com/) / [Qwik](https://qwik.dev/) and many other Frameworks... but in Godot!

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer ‚ö†Ô∏è

This should be seen as a proof of concept and **not ready for production**. While most logic was ported over, there still needs to be more testing to be done.

Logic was sourced from [proposal-signals](https://github.com/proposal-signals/proposal-signals) and translated to GDScript.
Big shoutout to everyone who contributed to the proposal or worked on the demo in said proposal. ‚ù§Ô∏è

## Usage

```gdscript
var counter = R.state(0)

var displayText = R.computed(func(_ignore):
    return "Counter: " + str(counter.value)
)

$AddButton.button_down.connect(func(): counter.value += 1)
$SubtractButton.button_down.connect(func(): counter.value -= 1)

R.effect(func(_ignore):
    $CounterLabel.text = displayText.value
)
```

### Explanation

`R.` (R-dot) is the namespace for all Rdot functions.

`R.state` is a function that creates a reactive state. It returns an object with a `value` property that you can read and write to.
The methods `do_get` and `do_set(value)` are also available but behave the same as `value`.
```gdscript
var counter = R.state(0)
```

`R.computed` recalculated it's value each time a reactive value in the function changes. It returns an object with a `value` property that you can read.
The first argument can be ignored but has to be there for Godot to not complain.
```gdscript
var double = R.computed(func(_ignore):
    return counter.value * 2
)
```

`R.effect` can be used to synchronize the reactive state with the UI. It its rerun each time a reactive value in the function changes.

```gdscript
R.effect(func(_ignore):
    print("Double changed: ", double.value)
)
```
